I am currently a PhD student at Department of Industrial System Engineering and Management of {{< staticref "https://nus.edu.sg/" "newtab" >}}National University of Singapore{{< /staticref >}}, supervised by {{< staticref "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=99AJNXEAAAAJ" "newtab" >}}Prof. Chee Yeow Meng{{< /staticref >}} and {{< staticref "https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=iDEgcFQAAAAJ" "newtab" >}} Prof. Andrew Lim {{< /staticref >}}. I work closely with {{< staticref "https://sites.google.com/view/jtang" "newtab" >}}Prof. Jing Tang{{< /staticref >}}. Before learning in NUS, I received my B.E. degree from the School of Automation,Â {{< staticref "https://en.nwpu.edu.cn" "newtab" >}}Northwestern Polytechnical University{{< /staticref >}} in 2017.

My research interests center around blockchain and cryptocurrency, especially token economics and decentralized systems. Besides research, I actively invest crypto ventures for profit and fun.
