## Investment Thesis

As a long-term supporter of cryptocurrency, I invest in ventures that make significant technical contributions to decentralization. My focus is on technological innovations that have the potential to disrupt traditional business models or create new demands. Although I typically make only a few investments each year, I often lead the first round of funding alongside my friends when I identify a clear opportunity. I take pride in becoming the first investor in teams that present fresh narratives or unique insights into established markets. Each investment is a interesting research project for me where I rigorously analyze every aspect. 

## My primary interests

1. Open and Free Internet Infrastructure and Applications. 
2. "Small-and-sweet" crypto native applications that further improve capital efficiency. 
3. Novel proof mechanism / Novel economical design ponzi. 
4. Anonymous communication/transaction.
5. AI agents with new business insights. 

Here are my investment portfolio selections (altcoin).
