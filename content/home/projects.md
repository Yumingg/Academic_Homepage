As a long-term believer of cryptocurrency, I actively invest in crypto venture projects with nontrivial technical contributions in decentralization, no matter in bull/bear cycle. 

Some of my recent interests (not limit to) are as follows. 

1. New applications in zero-knowledge proof. 
2. Novel proof mechanism.
3. Novel economical design. 
4. New consensus algorithm with solid theory. 
5. New progress on anonymous communication/transaction.

Here are my favourite portfolio selections (altcoin).
