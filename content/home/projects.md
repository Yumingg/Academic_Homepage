As a long-term believer of cryptocurrency, I actively invest in crypto venture projects with nontrivial technical contributions in decentralization, no matter in bull/bear cycle. I prefer the Technological innovations that can disrupt existing business models or generate new demands.

1. Open and Free Internet Infrastructure and Applications. 
2. "Small-and-sweet" crypto native applications. 
2. Novel proof mechanism / Novel economical design. 
3. Anonymous communication/transaction.
5. AI agents with business potentials. 

Here are my favourite portfolio selections (altcoin).
