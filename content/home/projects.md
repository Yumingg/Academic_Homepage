As a long-term believer of cryptocurrency, I actively invest in crypto venture projects with nontrivial technical contributions in decentralization, no matter in bull/bear cycle. 

Some of my recent interests (not limit to) are as follows. 

1. New applications in zero-knowledge proof. 
2. Miner extractable value. 
3. Novel proof mechanism / Novel economical design. 
4. "Small-and-sweet" crypto native applications. 
5. Anonymous communication/transaction.

Here are my favourite portfolio selections (altcoin).
